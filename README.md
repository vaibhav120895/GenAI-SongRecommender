This is a simple song recommendation tool I created while learning how to build applications with chatGPT API.



Install VS Code
Download the index.html, server.js, script.js and .env file in your root folder.
Generate API Key from Open AI. Guide: https://help.openai.com/en/articles/4936850-where-do-i-find-my-secret-api-key. Paste this API key in .env file
On your terminal, run commands to install node js
Run node server.js to check the port number. If it's different than 8080, update your port number on script.

Open Browser and go to 'http://localhost:portnumber'
